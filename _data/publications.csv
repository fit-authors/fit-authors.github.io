1,K. Meira Goldberg,Sonidos Negros : on the blackness of flamenco,"Sonidos Negros traces how, in the span between 1492--the year in which Christian reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula coincided with Christopher Columbus's landing on Hispaniola--and 1933--when Andalusian poet Federico Garcâia Lorca published his 'Theory and Play of the Duende'--the Moor became Black, and how the imagined Gitano (""Gypsy,"" or Roma) embodies the warring images and sounds of this process. By the nineteenth-century nadir of its colonial reach, Spanish identity came to be enacted in terms of a minstrelized Gitano, a hybrid of American and Spanish representations of Blackness. The imagined Gypsy about which flamenco imagery turns dances on a knife's edge delineating Black and White worlds. Teetering between ostentatious and damning confusion and the humility of epiphany, this figure relates to an earlier Spanish trope: the pastor bobo (foolish shepherd), who, seeing an angelic apparition, must decide whether to accept the light of Christ--or remain in darkness. Spain's symbolic linkage of this religious peril with the Blackness of enslavement constitutes the evangelical narrative which vanquished the Moors and enslaved the Americas, an ideological framework that would be deployed by all the colonial slaving powers. The bobo's precarious state of confusion, appealingly comic but also holding the pathos of the ultimate stakes of his decision--heaven or hell, safety or extermination--opens up a teeming view of the embodied politics of colonial exploitation and creole identity formation. Flamenco's Sonidos Negros live in this eternal moment of bulla, the confusion and ruckus that protect embodied resistance to subjugation, the lament for what has been lost, and the values and aspirations of those rendered imperceptible by enslavement and colonization.",http://books.google.com/books?id=xdp1DwAAQBAJ&hl,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xdp1DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE72Rr75gqOLq8D3-4_uZH3H9rY77haxwQBz4ZACigT4w1uAYCpe03VMtSJ3UNsokX_BZaCk8j8eg8fv5wBpIx6DHydA192COJpViM1UkninImfkar_O2nZES18VW7OCqbXNz2bId&source=gbs_api,2019,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000162030,"Film, Media and Performing Arts",Liberal Arts
2,Andrea Kleine,Eden : a novel,"A bold, page-turning novel that follows how a childhood abduction sets two sisters on very different courses ... Every other weekend, Hope and Eden--backpacks, Walkmans, and homework in hand--wait for their father to pick them up, as he always does, at a strip-mall bus stop. It’s the divorce shuffle; they’re used to it. Only this weekend, he’s screwed up, forgotten, and their world will irrevocably change when a stranger lures them into his truck with a false story and smile. More than twenty years later, Hope is that classic New York failure: a playwright with only one play produced long ago, newly evicted from an illegal sublet, working a humiliating temp job. Eden has long distanced herself from her family, and no one seems to know where she is. When the man who abducted them is up for parole, the girls might be able to offer testimony to keep him jailed. Hope sets out to find her sister--and to find herself--and it becomes the journey of a lifetime, taking her from hippie communes to cities across the country. Suspenseful and moving, Eden asks: how much do our pasts define us, and what price do we pay if we break free?",http://books.google.com/books?id=d7osDwAAQBAJ&hl,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=d7osDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE71nMMRFYxSA3fIr8PSoacbQFbEGr5iwsGQRWPHlBV-8z1r64xK0qWkMwwHnQFY_PWBH8L1_5WSlapM3LVQfuD2adj4VfaTVGRVB2VNHHJ5_mr1JkH14nixJD0_9iXPIYFozr3pG&source=gbs_api,2018,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000161331,Acquisitions & Metadata Services,Library
3,Amy Werbel,Lust on trial : censorship and the rise of American obscenity in the age of Anthony Comstock,"Anthony Comstock was America’s first professional censor. From 1873 to 1915, as Secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, Comstock led a crusade against lasciviousness, salaciousness, and obscenity that resulted in the confiscation and incineration of more than three million pictures, postcards, and books he judged to be obscene. But as Amy Werbel shows in this rich cultural and social history, Comstock’s campaign to rid America of vice in fact led to greater acceptance of the materials he deemed objectionable, offering a revealing tale about the unintended consequences of censorship. In Lust on Trial, Werbel presents a colorful journey through Comstock’s career that doubles as a new history of post–Civil War America’s risqué visual and sexual culture. Born into a puritanical New England community, Anthony Comstock moved to New York in 1868 armed with his Christian faith and a burning desire to rid the city of vice. Werbel describes how Comstock’s raids shaped New York City and American culture through his obsession with the prevention of lust by means of censorship, and how his restrictions provided an impetus for the increased circulation and explicitness of “obscene” materials. By opposing women who preached sexual liberation and empowerment, suppressing contraceptives, and restricting artistic expression, Comstock drew the ire of civil liberties advocates, inspiring more open attitudes toward sexual and creative freedom and more sophisticated legal defenses. Drawing on material culture high and low, including numerous examples of the “obscenities” Comstock seized, Lust on Trial provides fresh insights into Comstock’s actions and motivations, the sexual habits of Americans during his era, and the complicated relationship between law and cultural change.",http://books.google.com/books?id=9UpBDwAAQBAJ&hl,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9UpBDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE73r1LyrGQ0GVLbtki3fl_OimeAo_0_oF8l9meZPQH6XOJN9HcOyAnP8CI5zmzBmXCR7MXVkMH6W3k8f8EZVjQKts2ogGXM1SVaZWtxdEYjxMprgtrwadmxVxoS5vyCDb3IJ7GZU&source=gbs_api,2018,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000160209,History of Art,Liberal Arts

Curated by Andrew Weinstein. Located in The Cooper Union Library. The bodies of people of color, the poor around the world, the incarcerated and military personnel have a history of being used as tissue for research. In 1946-47 Americans held Nazi doctors to account at the Nuremberg Doctors' Trial and initiated modern bioethics with the mandate of ""informed consent"" for human research subjects. Nevertheless, the U.S. government-funded Tuskegee syphilis study continued for decades after. Now that researchers pursue genomics toward an unknown future, does bioethics have what it takes to address still different challenges?

6,Lourdes Font,The hidden history of American fashion : rediscovering twentieth-century women designers,"This book is the first in-depth exploration of the revolutionary designers who defined American fashion in its emerging years and helped build an industry with global impact, yet have been largely forgotten. Focusing on female designers, the authors reclaim a place in history for the women who created not only for celebrities and socialites, but for millions of fashion-conscious customers across the United States. From one of America's first couturiers, Jessie Franklin Turner, to Zelda Wynn Valdes, the book captures the lost histories of the luminaries who paved the way in the world of American fashion design. This fully illustrated collection takes us from Hollywood to Broadway, from sportswear to sustainable fashion, and explores important crossovers between film, theater, and fashion.

7,Rebecca Bauman,"Masculinity, melodrama and quality TV : reviewing La piovra","The 1980s Italian television series La piovra (The Octopus) is the first important televisual intervention on the Mafia, yet it is often forgotten in contemporary television scholarship. This article positions La piovra in the current trend of 'quality' television by locating it in the subgenre of male melodrama. This article demonstrates that La piovra is not just an expose of organized crime but is a complex meditation on the vulnerability of Italian masculinity, a thematic that likens the series to today's male-themed quality television series and makes a critical re-evaluation of the show timely.",,/assets/images/bauman-cover.jpg,2018,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000161288,Modern Languages & Cultures,Liberal Arts
8,Marcia Biederman,Popovers and candlelight : Patricia Murphy and the rise and fall of a restaurant empire,"What would you do with your last sixty dollars? If you were Patricia Murphy you’d turn it into a fortune by buying a rundown Brooklyn diner. On the cusp of the Great Depression, the diner became an overnight sensation, the first of nine popular Patricia Murphy’s Candlelight Restaurants that opened over the course of four decades in New York and Florida. Popovers and Candlelight recounts how Murphy bucked Mad Men–erasexism in a male-dominated field and created remarkable dining experiences with solid American fare, a talented staff, and eye-popping décor. Dripping in diamonds, she transcended ethnic prejudices to become a socialite and built a brand that sold fragrance as well as food. Mutinous siblings, a desperate manager, and a typhoid outbreak brought it all to an operatic end, but Marcia Biederman restores Murphy and her contributions to their proper place in women’s and culinary history. This book will delight readers with its rags-to-riches story and fascinating view of class, gender, ethnicity, and food culture during much of the twentieth century.",http://books.google.com/books?id=sDFuDwAAQBAJ&hl,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=sDFuDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&imgtk=AFLRE70q8DSOyXtpSXL5piSswTA6D9m-mtU9H4BE8PSqGE7CFhc77KhG0zcWB71lpbXmDy1vTM8I0VotPrtwWzj2dQ6nyiZa6oK_xkatakaJ9l-aGiXPyUC1uqr593Z_ZdZOHtTX7_Om&source=gbs_api,2018,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000161966,ESL and the Fashion Business,Center for Continuing and Professional Studies

Exposing our seemingly insatiable longing for a life that is purely a construct of the advertising industry, Jacquette's work focuses on commercialized objects of desire: prepared meals drawn from 1950s cookbook illustrations, ornate interiors of the wealthy sampled from contemporary lifestyle magazines, shimmering swimming pools extracted from luxury ad campaigns.

Readers will explore a comprehensive array of contemporary issues and technology to facilitate and safeguard marketing success. Because design, raw materials, production, and sourcing are inexorably intertwined in the process of creating and delivering the goods today’s consumers want, at a price they can afford, this book addresses these topics. With the apparel and home textile industries spanning six continents, this textbook includes an overview of importing, trade agreements, non-tariff barriers, and government regulations. As the key to protecting reputation, brand and regulatory compliance is reviewed. Readers will explore leading practices in big data, branding, and communications vehicles necessary for success in today’s apparel and home textile marketing.

23,Justine De Young,"Fashion in European Art: Dress and Identity, Politics and the Body, 1775-1925","Fashion reveals not only who we are, but whom we aspire to be. From 1775 to 1925, artists in Europe were especially attuned to the gaps between appearance and reality, participating in and often critiquing the making of the self and the image. Reading their portrayals of modern life with an eye to fashion and dress reveals a world of complex calculations and subtle signals. Extensively illustrated, Fashion in European Art explores the significance of historical dress over this period of upheaval, as well as the lived experience of dress and its representation. Drawing on visual sources that extend from paintings and photographs to fashion plates, caricatures and advertisements, the expert contributors consider how artists and their sitters engaged with the fashion and culture of their times. They explore the politics of dress, its inspirations and the reactions it provoked, as well as the many meanings of fashion in European art, revealing its importance in understanding modernity itself.",https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp4NuAEACAAJ,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=kUvPsgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2017,,History of Art,Liberal Arts

27,Valerie Steele,Paris Fashion: A Cultural History,"Paris has been the international capital of fashion for more than 300 years. Even before the rise of the haute couture, Parisians were notorious for their obsession with fashion, and foreigners eagerly followed their lead. From Charles Frederick Worth to Gabrielle ""Coco†? Chanel, Christian Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent, fashion history is dominated by the names of Parisian couturiers. But Valerie Steele's Paris Fashion is much more than just a history of great designers. This fascinating book demonstrates that the success of Paris ultimately rests on the strength of its fashion culture – created by a host of fashion performers and spectators, including actresses, dandies, milliners, artists, and writers. First published in 1988 to great international acclaim, this pioneering book has now been completely revised and brought up to date, encompassing the rise of fashion's multiple world cities in the 21st century. Lavishly illustrated, deeply learned, and elegantly written, Valerie Steele's masterwork explores with brilliance and flair why Paris remains the capital of fashion.",https://books.google.com/books?id=CK41DwAAQBAJ,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=CK41DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2017,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000158784,Museum at FIT,Museum at FIT

How have sneakers come to gain this status and what makes them fashionable? In what ways are sneaker subcultures bound up with gender identity and why are sneakerholics mostly young men? Based on the author's own ethnographic fieldwork in New York, where sneaker subculture is said to have originated, this unique study traces the transformation of sneakers from sportswear to fashion symbol. Sneakers explores the obsessions and idiosyncrasies surrounding the sneaker phenomenon, from competitive subcultures to sneaker painting and artwork.

The US was entering a deep recession, Russia was our enemy, and John Hinckley, Jr.’s assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan shocked the nation.

The word flamenco evokes the image of a sensuous and rebellious woman--the bailaora --whose movements seduce the audience, only to reject their attention with a stomp of defiance. The dancer's body is an agent of ideological resistance, conveying a conflicting desire for subjectivity and autonomy and implying deeply held ideas about history, national identity, femininity and masculinity.

As co-founders of Miss Jessie's, Miko reveals how she and Titi applied those lessons to create a successful business from scratch. A family memoir with a wealth of practical business advice and handy hair tips, told in Miko's funny and relatable voice, Miss Jessie’s is her remarkable story — from her childhood learning independence as a latchkey kid in Jamaica, Queens, to building a highly regarded company with her sister in their shared home salon in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Miko reflects on her hard-won insights working for her autocratic, iron-fisted father, and how the self-sufficiency she learned in childhood helped her blossom as a single mother with bills to pay, a child to raise, and a dream to pursue. She speaks honestly of her mistakes and successes, and of her role as an industry leader, negotiating multi-million dollar deals while at the same time restoring the self-esteem of natural and curly haired women.

51,William H. Mooney,Dashiell Hammett and the movies,"As the father of the hardboiled detective genre, Dashiell Hammett had a huge influence on Hollywood. Yet, it is easy to forget how adaptable Hammett’s work was, fitting into a variety of genres and inspiring generations of filmmakers. Dashiell Hammett and the Movies offers the first comprehensive look at Hammett’s broad oeuvre and how it was adapted into films from the 1930s all the way into the 1990s. Film scholar William H. Mooney reveals the wide range of films crafted from the same Hammett novels, as when The Maltese Falcon was filmed first as a pre-Code sexploitation movie, then as a Bette Davis screwball comedy, and finally as the Humphrey Bogart classic. He also considers how Hammett rose to Hollywood fame not through the genre most associated with him, but through a much fizzier concoction, the witty murder mystery The Thin Man. To demonstrate the hold Hammett still has over contemporary filmmakers, the book culminates in an examination of the Coen brothers’ pastiche Miller’s Crossing. Mooney not only provides us with an in-depth analysis of Hammett adaptations, he also chronicles how Hollywood enabled the author’s own rise to stardom, complete with a celebrity romance and a carefully crafted public persona. Giving us a behind-the-scenes look at the complex power relationships, cultural contexts, and production concerns involved in bringing Hammett’s work from the page to the screen, Dashiell Hammett and the Movies offers a fresh take on a literary titan.",https://books.google.com/books?id=KOWaBAAAQBAJ,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=KOWaBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2015,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000145043,,

56,Deidre Clemente,Dress casual : how college students redefined American style,"As Deirdre Clemente shows in this lively history of fashion on American college campuses, whether it's jeans and sneakers or khakis with a polo shirt, chances are college kids made it cool. The modern casual American wardrobe, Clemente argues, was born in the classrooms, dormitories, fraternity and sorority houses, and gyms of universities and colleges across the country. As young people gained increasing social and cultural clout during the early twentieth century, their tastes transformed mainstream fashion from collared and corseted to comfortable. From east coast to west and from the Ivy League to historically black colleges and universities, changing styles reflected new ways of defining the value of personal appearance, and, by extension, new possibilities for creating one's identity. The pace of change in fashion options, however, was hardly equal. Race, class, and gender shaped the adoption of casual style, and young women faced particular backlash both from older generations and from their male peers. Nevertheless, as coeds fought dress codes and stereotypes, they joined men in pushing new styles beyond the campus, into dance halls, theaters, homes, and workplaces. Thanks to these shifts, today's casual style provides a middle ground for people of all backgrounds, redefining the meaning of appearance in American culture.",https://books.google.com/books?id=b15iAwAAQBAJ,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=b15iAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,2014,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000142059,FIT Alumni,

76,Roger Padilha,"Antonio Lopez fashion, art, sex & disco","The first complete monograph on Antonio Lopez, the influential Warholian fashion illustrator of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. Best known for dazzling illustrations in Women's Wear Daily, Vogue, the New York Times, Interview, and for high fashion labels, Antonio Lopez (1943-1987) was a force majeur in the fashion world for three decades. In the '60s, Lopez's vibrant illustrations helped usher youth culture into the pages of magazines, setting a new, free-flowing, sexually liberated standard for fashion imagery. Living in Paris during the 70s with his creative partner Juan Ramos, Lopez launched the modeling careers of Jerry Hall, Grace Jones, and Jessica Lange among others, worked with design royalty like Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent, and cultivated a soign� nightlife persona in the blistering-hot underground clubs of Paris. Returning to New York City in 1976, Antonio documented the sexy influence of athletic-wear, puffy, down coats, and break-dancing style, inspiring such designers as Norma Kamali and Anna Sui. Widely recognized during this period as the world's most influential fashion illustrator, Antonio's work took on a deeper, more sculptural dimension in the 80s, richly detailed, with a vivid palette, and heroic proportions and poses. So deft and varied in his expression, Antonio Lopez simultaneously executed campaigns for labels as diverse as Norma Kamali, YSL, Valentino, Missoni, and Versace--an unprecedented feat in a highly competitive industry. The prolific Lopez produced an incredible number of drawings, illustrations, paintings, photographs, and fantastic mixed-media journals, and this book showcases his most iconic works, as well as never-before-seen Instamatic photos, behind-the-scenes Polaroids, letters, and ephemera which, together, provide an understanding of the career trajectory of an extraordinarily talented artist, and convey Antonio Lopez's enduring influence on fashion today.

Although they have depicted fashionable subjects throughout history, for many artists and writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Émile Zola, Gustave Caillebotte, Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, fashion became integral to the search for new literary and visual expression. In a series of essays that examine fashion and its social, cultural, and artistic context during some of the most important years of the Impressionist era--years that also gave birth to the modern fashion industry--a group of fifteen scholars, drawn from five interdisciplinary fields, examine approximately 140 Impressionist-era artworks, including those by dedicated fashion portraitists, in light of the rise of the department store, new working methods for designing clothing, and new social and technological changes that led to the democratization of fashion and, simultaneously, its ascendance as a vehicle for modernity.",https://books.google.com/books?id=5jWyuAAACAAJ&hl,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=5jWyuAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2012,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000138280,History of Art,Liberal Arts

Geographically and stylistically defined, subcultures such as Lolita in Harajuku, Gyaru and Gyaru-o in Shibuya, Age-jo in Shinjuku, and Mori Girl in Kouenji, reflect the affiliation and identities of their members, and have often blurred the boundary between professionals and amateurs for models, photographers, merchandisers and designers. Based on insightful ethnographic fieldwork in Tokyo, Fashioning Japanese Subcultures is the first theoretical and analytical study on Japans contemporary youth subcultures and their stylistic expressions.

101,Amy Lemmon,Saint Nobody,"Amy Lemmon’s stunning and heart-wrenching debut, Saint Nobody, offers us a profound meditation on the body, on the tribulations and the hard-found joys of incarnation. Lemmon does not shy away from a world where “vestigial angel-parts ache to emerge” and where there doesn’t appear to be a “speck of God.” This piercing meditation takes the problem of the body, and the problem of the body in a world that often seems God-less, head-on, without flinching, and yet delivers us truths and beauty we would never have imagined. Lemmon knows that we can’t count on the intercession of an absent saint, and she refuses easy solace. Instead, she probes deeply into the pain, into the conflicting emotions of childbirth, into the birth of a child with Down Syndrome – which is probably the most extraordinary poem written on that subject – to understand the life of our body here, the body in which “pain is sharpest where my wings would be.” This is a world of urine samples, “errant” chromosomes, lost kisses, first bleedings, chaotic cells, and scars, where the blood seems ours alone, and where the words are the only bread we have that may deliver us. In the bread of her words, Lemmon has given us a profound sacrament.",https://books.google.com/books?id=gVj-PAAACAAJ,https://books.google.com/books/content?id=gVj-PAAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,2009,https://fit.sunyconnect.suny.edu:4699/F?func=direct&doc_number=000122249,English and Communication Studies,Liberal Arts
