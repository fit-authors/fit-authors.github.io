The Fashion Designer's Sketchbook is a step-by-step guide to making and using sketchbooks as an experimental design lab to visually explain your design ideas. Three distinct types of sketchbook, each representing a different phase in the design process, evolve from initial inspiration journal, to design development sketchbook, to the job-search presentation sketchbook as portfolio companion. The power of a sketchbook lies in visual storytelling. In these pages, professional designers and student contributors tell the visual story of the creative process with their unique sketchbook examples, and concept-to-design experimentations, throughout a range of aesthetic levels and target markets. Individual editing scenarios, sketching styles, and graphic strategies show how to project aesthetics into a cohesive sketchbook presentation.
