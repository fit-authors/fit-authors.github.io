Couturier to the stars and famed designer Kenneth D. King brings his Belle Epoque sensibilities to the world of custom doll clothing construction in _Doll Couture_. Inspired by his viral social media stories of Crazy Bella and her high-fashion friends, _Doll Couture_ showcases King's one-of-a-kind designs for clothes that fit 11-1/2 inch fashion dolls. 

Doll fashion has a long history within the tableau of clothing construction as the first way many people who sew started their sewing journeys. What sewing-crazy kid doesn't remember creating outfits for a favorite doll? Doll clothing was the entry point for so many, and it remains a craft that speaks to the intricacies of detail work that go into all clothing construction.

The recently renewed interest in doll culture, nostalgic focus on collectibles, and renewed interest in the fiber arts make this the perfect time to step into this space. Guided by King, an expert in couture sewing who threads the needle between the mechanics of garment construction and the visual feast of rich fabrics and design, _Doll Couture_ will be a one-of-a-kind project that both delights and inspires.
