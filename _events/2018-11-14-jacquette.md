Unrequited & Acts of Play is Prof. Jacquette's first major monograph. It presents an artistic exploration through the materialism, elitism, and idealization of past and contemporary society. Through her richly detailed paintings featuring imagery drawn from advertisements, Jacquette addresses the challenges of navigating the contemporary media landscape that so directly influences our sense of personal identity and self-worth.

Through exquisite drawings and storytelling Prof. Jacquette's graphic memoir, Playground of MY Mind, provides a distinctive account of the artist's childhood in Manhattan in the 1960s and 1970s.
