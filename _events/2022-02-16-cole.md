This book explores fashion not simply from an aesthetic point of view but also as a manifestation of social and cultural change.  Focusing on fashion from 1850, the authors consider the evolution of womenswear, menswear, and childrenswear. The book looks at the dissemination of style and the mechanisms of change, at the relationship between fashion and the visual, applied, and performing arts, the intertwined relationship between fashion and popular culture, the impact of new materials and technology, and the growing globalization of style.
