Dr. Martin's research examines the effect of social support (SS) on psychological distress (depression and anxiety) among Black breast cancer survivors (BBCS), and the possible mediating effect of fear of recurrence (FOR) on this relationship. The manuscript is being finalized for submission to the _Journal of Cancer Survivorship_.
