*Artists of Provincetown* by fine art photographer Ron Amato seeks to not only celebrate, but preserve the legacy of one of the nation’s oldest art colonies, now facing an uncertain future due to rising property values, corporate invasion, and what, in the book’s introduction, Pulitzer Prize winning author Michael Cunningham calls, “catastrophic expense.”

Made over a period of eight years, *Artists of Provincetown* contains 84 quietly immersive portraits that illustrate the breadth and depth of this 125-year-old community of painters, writers, photographers and sculptors.
