From finding inspiration to creating the final collection, this is the complete guide to putting together an attention-grabbing fashion portfolio. It follows the entire design process, covering research, quick sketches, silhouettes, mood boards, garment details, textiles, fabric manipulation, and draping experimentation. In addition to samples from professional sketchbooks, established fashion and accessories designers offer their personal insights on the job's highlights and challenges. This book demonstrates that creativity comes in many forms- with no right or wrong expression. A beautiful and practical book that helps readers get inside the designer's mind and at the same time learn how to develop your own fashion design collection and share your design ideas with maximum impact.
