*In Intimate Detail* is a comprehensive guide to all things lingerie, from bras to underwear to shapewear to loungewear. With dozens of vivid watercolor illustrations and gender neutral language, *In Intimate Detail* provides answers to underpinnings for everyone, including people who are pregnant or nursing, have had surgery or other physical concerns, or are trans/non-binary. It even addresses essential care and shopping advice, such as how to hand wash lingerie, how to pack for travel, or how to create a lingerie wardrobe.

In this beautiful and empowering guide, lingerie expert Cora Harrington demystifies intimate apparel, making it accessible to all sizes, ages, and budgets so you can confidently buy, wear, and care for the underpinnings of your dreams.
