***How did you come up with the idea?***  
Twenty years ago there were no books on Portfolio Presentation. A colleague in Fashion Design encouraged me to write it as a guide for students & as a tool for teaching techniques. Although technology has altered the industry considerably, hands-on skills still play an essential role. The ultimate portfolio consists of a distinct blend of technology, informational design skills & the designer's personal vision.

***What was your research process like?***  
I conducted in-person interviews with students, designers, creative design directors & merchandisers from a variety of markets for the best possible overview of portfolio practices and expectations.

***What are you proudest of?***  
This book is considered the benchmark text on the subject of portfolios and is required reading in many fashion design programs. Two decades after the original printing, the updated fourth edition remains as relevant today as it was 20 years ago.
