  title: Fashion Portfolio
  subtitle: Design + Presentation
  summary: From finding inspiration to creating the final collection, this is the complete guide to putting together an attention-grabbing fashion portfolio. It follows the entire design process, covering research, quick sketches, silhouettes, mood boards, garment details, textiles, fabric manipulation, and draping experimentation. In addition to samples from professional sketchbooks, established fashion and accessories designers offer their personal insights on the job's highlights and challenges. This book demonstrates that creativity comes in many forms- with no right or wrong expression. A beautiful and practical book that helps readers get inside the designer's mind and at the same time learn how to develop your own fashion design collection and share your design ideas with maximum impact.

***What was your research process like?***  
I've collaborated with nearly 100 contributors, including some American and European designers, as well as some graduate and undergraduate fashion design and textile art students from FIT, Parsons, and Central Saint Martins. Since my book aimed to feature all aspects of fashion industry, I was interested in contributions from various design specialists including knitwear, menswear, activewear, children's wear, lingerie, bridal , and accessory designers. One of the most unique contributions to the book was an article about history of fashion forecasting by David Wolfe, creative director of The Doneger Design Group.

***What are you proudest of?***  
This book is very visual and comprehensive. It explores the subject from every possible angle. Coordination of the input of nearly 100 contributors was a challenging and rewarding experience.
