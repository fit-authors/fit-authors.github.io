***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
After actively serving on FIT’s Sustainability Council for several years, attending and speaking at numerous sustainability and Fair Trade conferences, and organizing the ITM Sustainable Global Sourcing Forums, I was inspired to focus on publishing peer-reviewed journal articles related to sustainability and Fair Trade.   

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
This publication directly relates to my work at FIT, as I am incorporating elements of sustainability and Fair Trade into the courses that I teach including but not limited to Global Sourcing, Global Marketing, International Marketing Research and International Management.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
The most rewarding aspect of this publication is the introduction of the Compassion for Oneself, Others and the Environment (COOE) construct and scale into the literature.  This novel holistic measurement can be used by scholars and practitioners to study the correlation between consumers’ compassion levels and their purchasing patterns.
