work:
  title: Inspiritive
  summary: |
    A cycle of poems about the different way that artists can inspire, both with their art itself and the way they live their lives.

    "This collection is a rarity – page-turner, can't miss poetry. Elegies, homages, and one hell of an education in the author’s — and our own — rootedness in the accomplishments and frustrations of actors, musicians, poets and artists whose brushes with fame were as real and as raw as own anonymous struggles in life. Inside this book lies bad faith and gospel truth, sourmash whiskey, bennies and fate’s capricious betrayals -- the twists and turns and all the rest that flesh is heir to. The most famous in the crowd get a deserved reprise, and we are glad of that. But it is for those that took a slap in the face — those for whom shit happened in life that took them out of the limelight — that David Lawton reserves his greatest tribute, and deserves the greatest praise. Through his delightful word-magic, he gives the unsung and the unfairly ignored another chance to step up into the bright lights and take their bows."
