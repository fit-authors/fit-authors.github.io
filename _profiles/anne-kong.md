***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
I have been an advisor to Martin M. Pegler and VMD4-6 for many years.  Martin asked me to overhaul and update the 7th edition text.

***What was your research process like?***  
Intense. Retail and visual merchandising is changing faster than the speed of light, so eliminated several chapters and added new ones to update and refresh.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
This texbook relates directly to the courses we teach at FIT in Visual Presentation and Exhibition Design Program. I am also an active designer so I was able to use all of my industry connections. I serve on the executive board of [PAVE Global](http://paveglobal.org/) and my work there influenced the book as well.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
Believe it or not, one of my biggest challenges was getting permission for each of the 300 new images I used in the book. In some cases the image I wanted to use to demonstrate a particular design approach was a few months old and the store wanted me to use only current images.

***Is there other information we should know?***  
Our book received *The Best Business and Leadership Books of 2018*. The top Business and Leadership books of last year picked by Amazon Book Review Editor, Chris Schluep. It is also being considered for translation in Chinese.
