work:
  title: In American Fashion
  subtitle: Ruth Finley's Fashion Calendar
  summary: |
    *In American Fashion* is the first scholarly analysis of the *Fashion Calendar*, the unique scheduling service and trade publication for the American fashion and creative industries between 1941 and 2014.

    Published by Ruth Finley for almost seven decades, the *Calendar* had an extensive impact on the development of the American fashion industry in the 20th century. Unlike European fashion capitals, the American fashion industry relied on an independent small publisher to manage the schedule of an ever-growing industry. *In American Fashion* shows how this independent position influenced the democratic approach reflected in the industry in the United States. Finley's unique contribution to the development of the time-system and culture of American fashion made her a key player during the ascendency of American fashion design.

    Natalie Nudell unveils the *Fashion Calendar* as a historical archive, and also looks at its development into an [open-source digital humanities project](https://fashioncalendar.fitnyc.edu/ "Fashion Calendar Research Database") (released in November 2023). Through historical analysis and the upcoming digitization of the Ruth Finley Collection, this study unpacks the history and impact of the publication and the women behind it.
