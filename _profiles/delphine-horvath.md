***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
This idea came from a student in 2018.

***What was your research process like?***  
Intense.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
5 years. 

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
Yes, as this resource focuses on Cosmetics Marketing like the major at FIT.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
The biggest challenge was managing time in addition of handling a full-time faculty role. The most rewarding: publish the first marketing textbook devoted solely to the beauty industry. It will be core reading for undergraduate and graduate cosmetics programs across the globe and will provide students and teachers with a much-needed academic resource that simply does not exist today.
On the back cover of the book, this testimonial by Christine Chang, co-founder and co-CEO of the beauty brand Glow Recipe, states: "This insightful guide into the dynamic forces that continue to shape the cosmetics industry will serve as an invaluable resource to the current and next generation of leaders in beauty."
