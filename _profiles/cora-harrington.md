***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
When Ten Speed Press first approached me to write *In Intimate Detail*, I had been covering the lingerie industry for almost 10 years as *The Lingerie Addict*. In that time, I built a reputation as a trusted, knowledgeable resource for lingerie, not only on my own site where I offered trend reports, shopping advice, and product reviews, but also with other publications such as *The New York Times*, *The Wall Street Journal*, *Bloomberg*, *Women's Wear Daily*, *Vogue*, and others.

***What was your research process like?***  
My research process pulled heavily from my own work and experience. In my time as *The Lingerie Addict*, I'd developed an approach to discussing intimate apparel that was positive, welcoming, body neutral, and inclusive. In places where additional research was necessary, books like *Fashioning the Body* by Denis Bruna, *The History of Underclothes* by C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, *Corsets and Crinolines* by Nora Waugh, *Exposed: A History of Lingerie* by Colleen Hill, and *Fashion in Underwear: From Babylon to the Bikini Brief* by Elizabeth Ewing were all useful, among others.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
From the day I began working on it to the day it arrived in stores was approximately 18 months. 

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
Absolutely! For one, it's made me want to explore the idea of putting together an Intro to Lingerie course to continue the themes of my book in a more formalized and educational capacity.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
The biggest challenge of any writing project is the completion! A book deal is one thing, writing the book is something entirely different. I found that visiting bookstores and libraries did a lot to keep my motivation high. "If all these other people could write a book," I thought, "then I could too." The most rewarding part was seeing it in stores and on library shelves and written about in publications I'd admired for years. There's nothing like walking through a book shop and seeing your name on the shelf.

***Is there other information we should know?***  
It's an incredible honor to have my book on FIT's library shelves.

***Have you published any other books or have any upcoming publications?***  
Not yet! But hopefully soon!
