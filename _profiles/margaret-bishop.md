***How did you come up with the idea?***  
I searched for an appropriate and current textbook for the course and could not find any that were adequate and up to date.

***What was the hardest thing about publishing this book?***  
Remembering to write for a student audience that would be using the book to learn.

***What are you proudest of?***  
This book is used as the textbook for TT202, Textile Value Chain Marketing, a course I wrote. It is also highly valuable to textile and apparel professionals wanting an in-depth understanding of the entire textile value chain, through apparel and home textiles.
