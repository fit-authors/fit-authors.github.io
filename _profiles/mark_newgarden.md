about:
  - Professor at FIT since Fall 2021

work:
  title: How To Read Nancy
  co-author: Paul Karasik
  summary: |
    Everything that you need to know about reading, making, and understanding comics can be found in a single *Nancy* strip created by Ernie Bushmiller and published on Saturday, August 8, 1959.  

    *How To Read Nancy* reveals the syntax of a mass medium through the molecular deconstruction of a single comic strip. It also explores the benefits of deep reading, where focused contemplation reveals a subterranean world of hidden structures and ingenious choices.  

    Paul Karasik and Mark Newgardenâ€™s *How To Read Nancy* is part encyclopedia, part history, part biography, part treatise, part humor theory, and part how-to-be-a-cartoonist-in-43-easy-lessons-sorry-folks-no-refunds!
