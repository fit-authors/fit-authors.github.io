  title: Dress in the Age of Jane Austen / Jane Austen's Wardrobe
  summary: |
    A comprehensive and beautifully illustrated examination of dress, clothing, fashion, and sewing in the Regency seen through the lens of Jane Austen’s life and writings

    This lively book reveals the clothing and fashion of the world depicted in Jane Austen’s beloved books, focusing on the long Regency between the years 1795 and 1825. During this period, accelerated change saw Britain’s turbulent entry into the modern age, and clothing reflected these transformations. Starting with the intimate perspective of clothing the self, Dress in the Age of Jane Austen moves outward through the social and cultural spheres of home, village, countryside, and cities, and into the wider national and global realms, exploring the varied ways people dressed to inhabit these environments. Jane Austen’s famously observant fictional writings, as well as her letters, provide the entry point for examining the Regency age’s rich complexity of fashion, dress, and textiles for men and women in their contemporary contexts.

    Lavishly illustrated with paintings, drawings, historic garments, and fashion plates—including many previously unpublished images—this authoritative yet accessible book will help readers visualize the external selves of Austen’s immortal characters as clearly as she wrote of their internal ones. The result is an enhanced understanding of Austen’s work and time, and also of the history of one of Britain’s most distinctive fashion eras.

    New book, _Jane Austen's Wardrobe_, to be released in September 2023.

***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
During the first British lockdown for the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spring 2020, it suddenly popped into my head.

***What was your research process like?***  
This work builds on years of extensive research into letters, books, documents, objects, accounts, and artworks on the Regency period, drawing them together in new ways.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
Jane Austen's Wardrobe only took a year to write, but it is based on a decade of research into the subject earlier.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
Yes. As Chair of the MA Fashion and Textile Studies, this is an example of new research in the field which builds on object-centred research and adds to the rich history of dress the program promotes.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
The pandemic! It made access to many in person sources difficult, but also highlighted how far digital resources have developed which helped fill the gaps. It's rewarding to discover new information about Jane Austen, an incredibly well-studied woman, yet there's still things we don't know.

***Is there other information we should know?***  
_Dress in the Age of Jane Austen_ is the first full length scholarly work on Regency fashion. Its follow up, _Jane Austen's Wardrobe_, will dive into the clothing of the author herself, and forms the first systematic exploration of her wardrobe.
