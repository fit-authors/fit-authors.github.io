***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
I spent 5 years in Congo as Chief of the MONUSCO Video Unit from 2007-2012. In the process, I supervised a team of 10 video professionals showing the recovery of Congo from the Second Congo War involving 7 different African nations, which killed an estimated 5 million Congolese in the late 1990s. This is an important story which has been neglected by American mainstream media.

***What was your research process like?***  
We were fortunate to have access to MONUSCO air and ground transport, so we were able to produce a weekly video magazine MONUSCO REALITES documenting the recovery of Congo, and this program was broadcast on all major Congolese TV stations and reached an estimated 40 million Congolese every week.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
Since my compulsory retirement from MONUSCO in 2012, I have been trying to raise money for a number of projects on the DRC. Here is one:https://vimeo.com/263738160

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
I have been a writer/filmmaker working on projects around the world for the past 40 years, and all of my projects, be they in print , film or new media, have one thing in common: narrative content â€” and that is what I have been teaching at F.I.T. since 1997 in a variety of different courses.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***

***Is there other information we should know?***  
My F.I.T. students have been my biggest supporters since I made my award-winning feature doc [East Timor: Betrayal and Resurrection](https://youtu.be/j_s46-5R4OE) with invaluable contributions from F.I.T. interns, Jade Ann Benetatos, Mina Cho and Wonjoo Joen.
