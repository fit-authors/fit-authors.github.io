  title: Hipster Death Rattle
  summary: |
    In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the hippest neighborhood in New York, slacker reporter Tony Moran and his ex Magaly Fernandez get caught up in a missing person’s case—all the while avoiding a serial killer on the loose. Filled with a cast of colorful characters and told with sardonic wit, this fast-moving, intricately plotted novel plays out against a backdrop of rapid gentrification, skyrocketing rents, and class tension. New Yorkers and anyone fascinated with the city will love the story’s details, written like only a true native could.
