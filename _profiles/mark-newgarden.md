about:
  - Professor at FIT since Fall 2021

work:
  title: How To Read Nancy
  co-author: Paul Karasik
  summary: |
    Everything that you need to know about reading, making, and understanding comics can be found in a single *Nancy* strip created by Ernie Bushmiller and published on Saturday, August 8, 1959.  

    *How To Read Nancy* reveals the syntax of a mass medium through the molecular deconstruction of a single comic strip. It also explores the benefits of deep reading, where focused contemplation reveals a subterranean world of hidden structures and ingenious choices.  

    Paul Karasik and Mark Newgarden’s *How To Read Nancy* is part encyclopedia, part history, part biography, part treatise, part humor theory, and part how-to-be-a-cartoonist-in-43-easy-lessons-sorry-folks-no-refunds!

***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
*How to Read Nancy* was originally published as an essay in 1988 and developed during a semester that my co-author and I were teaching a comics class together.

***What was your research process like?***  
It was laborious. We interviewed dozens of people and combed private collections & archives worldwide for high resolution scans of hardcopy primary documents.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
Our book was literally decades in the making. The original 1988 essay became a staple in comics classes and we decided to expand it into a book length treatment. We thought it would be a sprint but the deeper we dug, the more there was to discover. It was almost another decade before we held an actual printed book in our hands.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
*How to Read Nancy* relates directly to my teaching practice (comics, storytelling, comics history).

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
The research and long-distance collaboration (Mark Lives in Brooklyn and Paul lives on Martha’s Vineyard.)

It was very rewarding to be recognized by our peers with an Eisner Award for the Best Comics-Related Book of 2018.
