***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
It's my personal poetry anthology in which I selected poems from 6 published poetry books.

***Does this publication relate to your work or teaching at FIT? If so, how?***  
Yes, even though we don't teach literature and poetry in our department.

***Is there other information we should know?***  
I write in Spanish and this year I would like to start translating myself. This will be an experiment.
