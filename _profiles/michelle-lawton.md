  title: Moderating a Love Affair with Food  
  summary: |
    Moderating a Love Affair with Food: 10 Tips to Mindful Eating and Drinking is an easy-to-read and entertaining guidebook for the industry pro, the food- and wine-obsessed, "foodie," home cook, or any eater who adores food and drink but is looking for a little help with moderating. The book offers ten tips for self-control based on a food pro's personal experience eating and drinking at home, work, and in social settings. The book covers subjects of self-care, moderating alcohol, cooking mindfully, eating out in restaurants and navigating the many tempting social situations we find ourselves in, and the expectations that others can put on us. Throughout the book, Michelle shares funny anecdotes about everyday life and examples of ways to pay attention to our mood and surroundings. What's different about this book? There are so many recipe books on the joy of cooking. And so many apps and programs on dieting or abstinence. This book is about loving yourself enough to enjoy everything in balance. Michelle draws on her experiences working in the food and wine industries, beginning as a corporate brand manager for super-premium Italian wines and Champagnes.
