***About Angela***  
My work is inspired greatly by the wildlife around my home and my favorite stories I read growing up. When working on children's books, I create images that appeals to my inner child, drawings with lots of details, color, and quality that captures the attention of the viewer. My process is hand inking with brush and pen my line work then I apply my colors digitally. When I'm not freelancing I teach illustration at the Fashion Institute and I am apprenticing to become a tattoo artist at [Little Wolf](https://www.littlewolftattoo.com/).
