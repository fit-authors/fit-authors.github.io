***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
My whole brand revolves around my connection to butterflies so when I decided to write a book I knew I wanted it to be in relation to them. This collection of work depicts the duality of metamorphosis. It gives insight on the process and shows how much strife was required to embody so much beauty. I think everything in life is just as beautiful as it is ugly and I find comfort in knowing that both are necessary in order to continue evolving. 

***What was your research process like?***  
I wanted the book to not only be my work but also have each poem be accompanied by a journal prompt because my poetry journey starting with journaling. I wanted the audience to be able to connect with my work on a deeper and personal level. I included poems that are universal topics that most people can find a relation to.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
There are poems in the book that are 7-8 years old but the curation of the book took me about 8 months.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
This work is completely different from my role at FIT. I majored in Interior Design and my book is a collection of my poetry. Both creative fields but they don't really go hand and hand.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
My biggest challenge was deciding which poems to include in the book. A lot of my performative pieces didn't make it into the book because I felt like there were things I did on stage that you can't experience by reading them. 

The most rewarding thing from this process was how much my community helped me through it. Friends I made from poetry helped me with the technical publishing process, photographing the cover, and some will be performing at my book release party on August 19, 2025.

***Is there other information we should know?***

Marlo's poetry remains a testament to the power of duality, displaying both vulnerability and toughness to convey the collective healing that art can foster.

This is my first published book and I plan to publish more in the near future.
