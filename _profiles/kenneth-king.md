***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
This is a continuation of the first book of Doll Couture, and some of the characters introduced there appear in the new book.

***What was your research process like?***  
Making doll clothes, really.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
This process took a year from the initial talks to the published book.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
Fashion is fashion, and I tell my students that if they know their craft they will always have work. While the clothes in this book are 1/6 scale, sewing is sewing.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
What is most rewarding is that I get to make red carpet clothes for these tiny "customers", and get to see them appear in public for the red carpet event shown in the book.

***Have you published any other books or have any upcoming publications?***  
I have 7 books (if you count the French edition). Also I'm a Contributing Editor for Threads Magazine.
