***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
The idea for this work originated from a routine that my roommate and co-author, Keenan Grooms, and I had developed. We would constantly be bringing in new articles of clothing into our apartment, trading pieces, and taking photos with our friends as we hung out—it was just what we did. At the time, none of us knew exactly why we were doing it, but as time went on, the project began to take shape before our eyes. Our apartment became the epicenter for our friends to gather, with clothes spread out everywhere from the couch to the hallways. This naturally led to a substantial collection of photos without any specific outlet to share them. That’s when the idea sparked between us to put these photos to use in print—a medium that intrigued us both, especially since we had previously worked on a few personal project zines.

***What was your research process like?***  
This first issue wasn’t centered around extensive research but rather on exploring the possibilities of the articles we had around us. The process of sourcing clothes was driven by personal well-being, with the knowledge that these pieces would eventually be featured in photographs.

***How long did you work on this before it was published?***  
1 year, but was primarily focused on in the summer of 2023.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
Yes, the book indirectly relates to my work at FIT in (ITM). Its open-ended nature allows viewers to interpret the content through various lenses, which connects to themes in ITM as well as broader themes related to the fashion industry. The book's exploration of layering, color pairing, and texture ties into fashion marketing's visual impact, while its social commentary on vintage versus fashion waste aligns with sustainability issues relevant to global trade. This is a project that welcomes the viewer into our world as if it were there own, creating their own narratives and reasoning to the content in-front of them. The book also aims to foster a DIY approach, encouraging viewers to believe that they can undertake similar creative projects. This approach aligns with our company's mission to provide education in design, instill values, and offer lifelong guidance, challenging the audience to explore their own abilities and perspectives.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
The biggest challenge was definitely navigating the technical aspects of the project—understanding formatting, bleeds, linking files, deciding where and how to print the copies, choosing the right paper, and selecting the photos. With two authors having equal say, there were moments of tension, especially when we disagreed on decisions like whether to delete a page or keep it. Since this was the first time either of us had designed a project of this magnitude, every problem that arose felt like a steep learning curve.

But the most rewarding part was not only overcoming those challenges but also including all of our friends in the project. It became a physical showcase of a specific moment in time within our friend group. Hosting an art gallery and book release for the first issue, surrounded by the support of those around us, felt like something I had always dreamed of. It was truly fulfilling to see everything come together and to share it with the people who mattered most.

***Have you published any other books or have any upcoming publications?***  
This is the first edition of the "Untitled" books, currently we are working on the second edition which is set to release within the year.
