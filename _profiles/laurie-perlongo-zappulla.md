  title: You're Going To Walk
  subtitle: Still Pressing On After Spinal Cord Injury
  summary: |
    I self published my memoir, "You're Going to Walk". It is my life story about sustaining a Spinal Cord Injury in 1979, I was 18, and it was two weeks before I entered college. I jumped into a swimming pool and was instantly paralyzed! I share my trauma, my pain and my survival in the pool that day and my survival since...it has been a 39 year journey of courage, hope and determination to "live" again. I share my inner struggles of becoming "different." I share how I struggled with being judged upon my appearance, and how people portrayed me as "only" disabled.  I was still a girl with dreams of being a fashionista and working for a major design house, but the world in the 80's wasn't ready for that.  It is a story of personal change and overcoming obstacles.

    "I hope that if you are a person struggling with any type of injury or illness or lack of confidence, that you too may find my story helpful. Helpful so that you too may find hope and encouragement through faith, family and friends. You too may find a new attitude and rise above it all. Keep knocking, keep seeking, and keep wiping away tears so that you may find a new you."

***How did you first come up with the idea for this work?***  
Whenever I would share my story with people, 99% of them would say, "Wow, you should write a book, it sounds like a movie." It has been a book in process since 1979. I remember living this work. I would often say, "This is chapter 22", when something incredible would happen.

***What was your research process like?***  
A lot of tears and deep thought. I had to remember events, people and conversations that happened 39 years ago. I was fortunate to find my doctors and therapist who were amazed that I was doing this. It was a very healing process.

***Does this work relate to your role at FIT? If so, how?***  
Yes, I share my efforts to be accepted as a full time student and living on campus. It was the first time for me to be independent, away from doctors, and my family. It took a lot of strength both physically and mentally to be able to maneuver on my own. It was a major challenge to be living in a dorm, with a hall bathroom. It was challenging getting my meals at the cafeteria. I walk with a cane and my body was still weak. I share about getting my first job at Revlon Inc.

***What was your biggest challenge? What was most rewarding?***  
My biggest challenge was me! I had to get used to being the person that people stared at, and it wasn't always because I looked runway ready. I lacked self confidence and my physical body was something to continuously work on. What was most rewarding was completing my bachelors degree and getting my first job at Revlon Inc, even if it was for a short time.

***Is there other information we should know?***  
I now do public speaking about disability awareness! I spoke at a Tedx event, and made a T-shirt to further my message...I want people to see my Ability, not my DisAbility. That t-shirt, has sparked a new career, I am soon launching a T-shirt and active wear collection with the hope to educate and motivate people to keep going and to never quit, no matter what obstacle is before you!
