> Discover the depth and breath of authors who teach, work, and study at FIT!  

FIT Authors is a collaboration between the Faculty Senate Library Committee and the FIT Library promoting FIT community scholarship and Library collections.  Two FIT authors are selected for the program each semester. The Faculty Senate Library Committee reviews authors' submissions and gathers information profiles. The Library hosts a small rotating display and coordinates an FIT authors event.  The site maintains a profile of each author, showcases associated events, and promotes select publications and a link to all FIT authored titles held in the Library.  

We encourage all FIT authors to contact fs_library_committee@fitnyc.edu stating your interest.  Please reach out to donate a copy of your book to the collection.
