> Discover the depth and breadth of authors who teach, work, and study at FIT!  

FIT Authors is a collaboration between the Faculty Senate Library Committee and the FIT Library to showcase the scholarship and creativity of the FIT community, as well as to promote our collections. Each semester, the Faculty Senate Library Committee collects submissions from authors within the FIT community (faculty, staff, and alumni) to create informative profiles. The FIT Library features these authors and their works in a rotating display, and hosts an FIT Authors event twice a semester. On this site, you can find [profiles](/profiles/) of FIT authors, a showcasing of associated [events](/events/), as well as a listing of all recently [published books](/publications/) by FIT authors.

We encourage all FIT authors to contact the [Faculty Senate Library Committee](mailto:fs_library_committee@fitnyc.edu) stating your interest.  Please reach out to [donate](mailto:libacquisition@fitnyc.edu) a copy of your book to the collection.
